tutorial at the beginning, or maybe friend helping out before having to go(Pinky? imo) . 
- Hid things around the various rooms to help you unlock more stuff. 
- Not a lot of puzzle solving yourself, just the piecing together by the detective. (aint happening here, probably gonna implement a button you can press at any point in the game to suspect and confront someone. around 5 different options :<)
-Guessing lock passwords 
- Collecting items ( idk maybe like random notes/clues)
- One constant background, with zoomed-in items(yea like computer screen etc. )
- probably similar to the Trapmaker, in which mysterious person gives calls & stuff to help out. (but in this case is Pinky)
